You are asked to come up with a set of 15 diverse task instructions. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. The task instructions should be diverse in terms of verbs, sentence structures, task types, and other relevant factors, to ensure that the GPT model is exposed to a wide range of linguistic and conceptual challenges.
2. The level of difficulty and complexity of the task instructions should be balanced with the need for diversity, and should be appropriate for a pre-trained language model.
3. The task instructions should be in English, and should be 1 to 2 paragraphs long. They can be in either imperative form or question form, or a combination of both, depending on the specific task.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
5. The instructions should be in English.
6. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 200 words.
7. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, "what is the highest peak in the world", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
8. The GPT model's performance will be evaluated based on a combination of factors, including accuracy, fluency, coherence, and other relevant factors. The evaluation criteria will be consistent across all tasks, and will be measured and compared across different tasks.
9. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 300 words.
